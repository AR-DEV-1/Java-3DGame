******* What this is *******

Prototype of a simple 3D game made using Java3D ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_3D )
This was done for a programming challenge in my 1st year OOP class. Development time was about 2 weeks.

******* How to run *******

All that is needed to run the Game is "3DGame.jar" and "run.sh". 
The run script will extract the relevant resources from the jar and then try to launch the game. On a Linux system, either 32 or 64 bit, it should work out of the box. 
I haven't tested it on other platforms.

******* How to play *******

The game's objective is simply to capture two randomly placed items(barrels) before the enemies and mines kill you.
You are equipped with lasers and missiles in your defense, but overuse will temporarily overheat and disable them.

You move with WASD and can independently rotate your torso with QE.
You aim with the mouse, left-click fires your laser, shift + left-click fires your missiles.

******* Features *******

Short Version: Check out the Screenshots

Long version:

- Environment randomly generated at beginning of game with diamond square algorithm, stored as quads
- Mipmap texturing of environment based on quad height (i.e. more grass at lower altitude, more dirt at higher)
- Hermite curve interpolation for realistic missile trajectory
- Point particle effects + animated gifs for explosions
- Minimap(generated on the fly) traces player and objectives location
- Lasers check if selected target can be hit from characters position (if not intermediate obstacle is hit)
- 3rd person camera follows player
- Laser tube rotate towards selected target (this one is buggy though)
- Background music + sounds
